## Arithmetic-operations

This calculator can perform the simple mathematical operations on numbers such as: 

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division
* `%` Modulus
* `^` Exponent

wich are entered in infix notations then converted to postfix notation before being computed (RPN).

## Mathematical-Functions
Computes trigonometric functions, and other functions listed below.

* `sin(...)` Sine.
* `cos(...)` Cosine.
* `tan(...)` Tangent.
* `arcsin(...)` Arcsine.
* `arccos(...)` Arccosine.
* `arctan(...)` Arctangent.
* `sqrt(...)` Square root.
* `cbrt(...)` Cube root.
* `log(...)` Logarithm.
* `exp(...)` Exponentiation (e^x).
* `abs(...)` Absolute value.
* `roundup(...)` Round up.
* `rounddown(...)` Round down.
* `min(...)` Minimum.
* `max(...)` Maximum.
* `sum(...)` Summation.
* `mean(...)` Mean.
* `var(...)` Variance.
* `avg(...)` Mean.
* `median(...)` Median.

This functions can be evaluated alongside the arithmetic oprations. eg. you can compute `6*(2^4) - 3*cbrt(9 * tan(3.14 / 2))`

### Matrix

Supprts matrix operations like matix:

* `Additions.`
* `Subtraction.`
* `Multiplication.`
* `Determinants.`
* `Transpose.`
* `Inverse.`

Can also perform matrix algorithms like
* `Reduced row echelon form.`
* `Solving simultaneous equatons.`

### Complex-numbers

Supporst basic oprations on complex numbers such as

* `Addition.`
* `Subtraction.`
* `Multiplication.`
* `Division.`

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
